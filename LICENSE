DISCLAIMER AND RISK WARNING

This software is experimental and provided for educational and research purposes only.
The FUSD Protocol is an algorithmic stablecoin implementation that carries significant risks.

BY USING THIS SOFTWARE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING:

1. EXPERIMENTAL NATURE
   - This is experimental software that has not undergone professional security audits
   - The protocol may contain bugs, vulnerabilities, or design flaws
   - Use at your own risk

2. NO GUARANTEE OF PEG STABILITY
   - FUSD is an algorithmic stablecoin that aims to maintain a $1.00 USD peg
   - There is NO GUARANTEE that the peg will be maintained
   - The token value may fluctuate significantly
   - Complete loss of value is possible

3. SMART CONTRACT RISKS
   - Smart contracts are immutable once deployed
   - Bugs or vulnerabilities cannot be easily fixed
   - Funds may be permanently lost due to contract errors
   - Admin keys, if compromised, could lead to total loss

4. ECONOMIC RISKS
   - Algorithmic stablecoins have historically failed (e.g., Terra UST)
   - Death spiral scenarios are possible
   - Insufficient liquidity can prevent peg recovery
   - Market manipulation is possible

5. REGULATORY RISKS
   - Regulatory status of algorithmic stablecoins is uncertain
   - Future regulations may restrict or prohibit use
   - Tax implications may apply
   - Compliance requirements may change

6. NO FINANCIAL ADVICE
   - This software does not constitute financial advice
   - Consult with qualified professionals before use
   - Do not invest more than you can afford to lose
   - Past performance does not indicate future results

7. NO WARRANTY

   - No guarantee of functionality, security, or fitness for purpose
   - No liability for any damages, losses, or claims
   - Use is entirely at your own risk

8. TESTNET ONLY RECOMMENDATION

   - Do not deploy to mainnet without:
     * Professional security audit
     * Comprehensive testing
     * Multi-signature governance
     * Insurance mechanisms
     * Legal review

9. CENTRALIZATION RISKS
   - Current implementation has single admin control
   - Admin compromise = total protocol failure
   - No multi-signature or DAO governance (yet)
   - Trust in admin is required

      * Securing your private keys
      * Understanding the risks
